Sk Nadim Hossain,A great upgrade from iPhone 11..The battery backup is great it is even better than iPhone 15pro which is obvious due to the proMotion 120hz display..Yes you'll feel the absence of 120hz but it doesn't matters that much until you play games yes you won't get 90fps on bgmi but yes still you can play games without any hesitation everyone mostly knows that and yes 60fps is enough coz our eyes can fully utilise the 60fps Higher fps are just eye pleasing..So It is not a big deal..Camera performance...,5,9 months ago,", Kolkata"
